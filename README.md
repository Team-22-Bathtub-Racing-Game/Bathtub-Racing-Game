# Southern Bathtub Race

**Southern Bathtub Race** was created by Caroline Roberson, Treonna Gardner, Jes Crouch, Jose Landaverde, and Jake Lashley for their SWE Capstone Project during Fall Semester 2025 at Kennesaw State University.



Beginning in the 1960s and running until the early 1990s, bathtub races were a central part of student life at Southern Polytechnic State University (SPSU) as they fostered a healthy blend of creativity and camaraderie from both their students and onlookers. Even after the annual races ended, they have remained a fondly remembered part of SPSU.



The goal of this project is to revive and commemorate the bathtub races in the form of a video game. You can view the project website, which contains more information about the historical races and the development team [here](https://team-22-bathtub-racing-game.github.io/Website/).
